HELP I CANT GET LOCAL LOGGING CONFIG, CHECK [this](https://github.com/koala9712/PyGrinder/blob/master/utils/Instance.py#L60-L79)

Hey!<br>
This is now one of my main projects, lookin forward to this!<br>
That being said, it is still not anywhere near usable, still in development.<br>

## Contributing
Glad you wanna, scroll down and check out my TODO list, now you know what to do!

## TODO:
This project was heavily inspired by [this one](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder) and hopes to achieve at least what the original program has done.<br>
I.E. shifts, instances, config etc

This should also support more functions such as daily, weekly, monthly etc, as well as be compatible with new updates.<br>
(also alot for my own experience so yes)

Currently, need to make logging use local config, not global ðŸ’€<br>

## Errors:
    - 200: Ok! With content
    - 204: Ok! Without content
