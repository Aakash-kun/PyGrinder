Hey! 
This is now one of my main projects, lookin forward to this! 
That being said, it is still not anywhere near usable, still in development.

## Contributing
Glad you wanna, scroll down and check out my TODO list, now you know what to do!

## TODO:
This project was heavily inspired by [this one](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder) and hopes to achieve at least what the original program has done.
I.E. shifts, instances, config etc

This should also support more functions such as daily, weekly, monthly etc, as well as be compatible with new updates.
(also alot for my own experience so yes)

Currently, need to make logging use local config, not global ðŸ’€
